MARS HELP & SUPPORT
===============================

Do not hesitate to contact the MARS developer team if you have any problems.

Ideally, in order to achieve an effective (speedy) diagnostic and
problem solving, we may need to have access to your machine (ssh or
similar is fine). Please understand that MARS is not an off-the-shelf
package.
